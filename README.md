This is a program that asks the user for the name of a ".lex" or ".set" file.
If the file is a ".lex" file, it saves it as a ".set". 
If it is a ".set" file it allows the user to see if the word exists in the .set file. You can use the included _english.set_ file to see if a word exists in the English language.
