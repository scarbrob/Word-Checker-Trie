This word checker program that takes a _.lex_ or _.trie_ file on initialization (if a _.lex_ file is given, the file is converted and saved as a _.trie_ file). The program then takes user input and uses a TRIE to check and see if the input exists within the .trie file. You can use the included _english.lex_ file to see if a word exists in the English language.
